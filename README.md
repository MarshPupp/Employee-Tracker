# Employee-Tracker

## Description ##
An application that allows you to create an employee database to keep track of all departments, roles and employees.

## Installation ##
To install this application you fist need to clone the repository from the link below and then access the integrated terminal. 
Once in the terminal run this command to install all needed dependencies.
```sh
npm install
```
After running the command edit the .env-example file to include your MySQL password and be sure to remove the "-example" from the file name.

Now you'll need to login to your MySQL shell using the command in the terminal.
```sh
mysql -u root -p
```
After you login you'll need to create the data base by entering this command in your MYSQL shell.
```sh
source db/schema.sql
```
From there the application will be ready to go but if you would like to test the application with the existing data you can run this command in your MYSQL shell.
```sh
source db/seeds.sql
```
